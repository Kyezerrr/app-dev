 My Favorite Series is **Naruto**.
 
Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village.

Uzumaki Naruto, the perfect protagonist, is one of the most well-written characters in anime. The story of Naruto Uzumaki is inspirational and quite emotional. As he was never readily accepted by many people in the village, he was always left out and had a rough childhood. This is what inspired him to work harder to become the Hokage one day.


My Favorite **Characters** in Naruto are 
1. **Naruto**
2. **Minato**
3. **Nagato**
